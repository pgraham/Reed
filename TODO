- Update CodeTemplateLoader to support more advanced substitutions.

  Planned upgrades include support for the following substitutions:

    ${join:name:glue}
    -----------------

      An inline substitution tag that joins each element of the named
      substitution value with the specified glue.

    ${template:name}
    ----------------

      Load and insert the temple with the given name.  Each line of the loaded
      template will be indented the same amount as the substitution tag.  This
      substitution tag must appear on a line that contains no text other than
      leading whitespace and the substitution tag.

    ${each:name}
    ------------
      
      Output each of the values in name on its own line.  Each line will be
      indented the same amount as the substitution tag.  If the substituted
      value contains multiple lines, each line in the value will also be
      indented.  This substitution tag must appear on a line that contains no
      text other than leading whitespace and the substitution tag.
