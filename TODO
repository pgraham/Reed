- Update CodeTemplateLoader to support more advanced substitutions.

  Planned upgrades include support for the following substitutions:

    ${if:name[expression]}...${fi:name}
    -------------------------------
    
      Only output someting if the named value is a boolean true (if no
      expression is specified) or if the given expression evaluates to true.
      This could also be expanded to include addition if expressions and an else
      clause.
