- Add logging interface:

  -What is already out there?
  -log4j has good extensible structure, can it be ported?

- There is some refactoring potential in the block parsing portion of
  CodeBlockParser.  A BlockDefinition interface can be created to handle the
  common aspects and an implementation for each block and if blocks can be
  created and used.  The if block implementation will need to override set code
  to parse out each of the clauses.
- Update EachBlock evaluation to handle indexed references.
- Refactor so that variable dererencing is all handled in one spot.
- Add support for deep indexing
- Allow text to apprear on the same line, after a block's closing tag.
